Description: An implementation of optimal case-control matching. It matches 1:n cases to controls 
             in an efficient and computationally flexible way. It uses the idea of sub-sampling in
             the level of the case, by creating pseudo-observations of controls. The user can select
             between replacement and without replacement, the number of controls, and several covariates 
             to match upon. See Mamouris (2021) <doi:10.1186/s12874-021-01256-3> for an overview.
